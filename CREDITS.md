West Coast Theme draws inspiration from:

- **Kimbie**  
  Origin: A warm, earthy theme designed to reduce brightness and emphasize natural tones.  
  Influence: The warm background palette used in West Coast Theme.

- **Andromeda**  
  Origin: A vibrant and modern dark theme with strong syntax contrasts.  
  Influence: Syntax highlighting concepts adapted and softened for readability.

Special thanks to the Visual Studio Code community and theme creators who continue to explore accessibility and aesthetics in developer tooling.
